<h1 class="text-4xl text-center text-red-600">Welcome to Svelte Kit + TailwindCSS Template</h1>

<p class="my-10 text-xl text-center">
	This is a barebones template that comes pre-configured with TailwindCSS and eslint for starting SvelteKit projects.
	Please make sure you have the Svelte for VSCode plugin installed. It provides prettier rules and even contains a
	eslint linter.
